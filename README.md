# Traffic Light Controller

This project aims to optimize traffic control at a T-shaped intersection using Verilog, focusing on minimizing vehicle wait times and enhancing traffic flow efficiency.

## Introduction

Efficient traffic management is crucial for urban environments to prevent accidents and reduce congestion. This Verilog-based hardware design approach improves traffic signal timing accuracy, ensuring smoother traffic flow and safer intersections.

### Verilog for Hardware Design

Verilog, a hardware description language (HDL), streamlines the design and simulation of digital circuits. It enables precise modeling and testing of traffic light control systems, enhancing reliability and reducing development time compared to traditional methods.

## Project Overview

This project implements a Verilog-based traffic light control system for a T-shaped road configuration.

### Traffic Light Control System

The system regulates intersection traffic flow with standard red, yellow, and green signals, coordinating pedestrian crossings for enhanced safety and efficiency.

### Traffic Light Functionality

- Red light: Halts traffic in all directions.
- Yellow light: Signals slowing down for cross-town traffic.
- Green light: Permits traffic to proceed safely.



### Challenges Addressed

Common traffic issues, such as congestion due to unregulated traffic levels and unnecessary waiting times, are mitigated through precise traffic level detection and configurable delay times.
